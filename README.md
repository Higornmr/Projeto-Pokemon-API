## React & Apollo Pokemon Application (http://bit.ly/CognitiveSurge)

This application (a Pokemon application) was built using create-react-app as a base, and the technologies used were React & Apollo. This was video was uploaded on my YouTube channel: http://bit.ly/CognitiveSurge - I'm hoping this tutorial helps out beginners who are learning React, Apollo & GraphQL.
